# Beginners Practicing Games in Python

Some silly games you can use to start familiarizing with Python language (understanding statements, loops, functions)

## What does this repository have to offer?

The documents provided in this repository are listed by **complexity order**. 

- Firsts games are a simple example of how **print/for/while/if/elif/else** statements work 

- Then a simple calculator using **Tkinter** (a binding interface for Python from the Tcl/Tk graphics library)

- Finally a more complex game using **Turtle library** (a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas).
